*Course Outline*

- Introduction to coding

- Programming concepts

- Scripting languages

- Creating applications

- Developing and publishing

Computational thinking: 

The objective of this course is to provide an introduction to coding. It aims to inspire students to create, learn and share using code. We will explore a number of different frameworks, platforms and coding languages depending on the student’s level and interests. By the end of the course, students will have coded some form of application that can run in the browser.

*Introduction to coding:*

We will look at different ways to ‘make’ using code, from creating browser applications to coding for visual arts and design.
Programming concepts: Here we will look at the programming concepts that underpin most coding languages

*Scripting languages:*

Focusing on Javascript and Python, we will look at how scripting languages can be used to solve complex problems.

*Creating applications:*

How are applications made? After the student chooses a mini project or problem they’d like to solve, we’ll code a solution.  
Sharing and development:
Once the project is finished, we will look at ways to deploy and share our work. 

**Course Length: Five Hours (11+)**
